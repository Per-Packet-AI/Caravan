# Artifact for Caravan (OSDI 2024)

This is the artifact repo for the paper _Caravan: Practical Online Learning of In-Network ML Models with Labeling Agents_ (to appear at OSDI 2024). 

## Overview

The paper artifact includes Caravan's software emulation and the FPGA+P4 testbed. The `emulation` folder contains the source code to automatically run key experiments from the paper and reproduce the corresponding figures (i.e., Figures 4a, 4b, 5--9, 10a, 10c). The `testbed` folder contains the new code changes and the instructions to set up and run the FPGA+P4-based evaluations for Caravan.

> **Note for AE reviewers:** The `testbed` folder is not required during artifact evaluation since it requires specialized hardware that is difficult for us to accommodate; however, anyone with the necessary hardware can try out the instructions.
